J3D
===

### Welcome
J3D is a extension for [GameMaker: Studio](http://www.yoyogames.com/studio) that makes it possible to build 3D games for HTML5 via the [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org/) JavaScript library, no plugins needed

### How it works
J3D uses CSS to "stack" the GameMaker generated canvas over a WebGL renderer, this allows you to continue using GameMaker for all your input controls, AI and GUI while being able to use the 3D features of ThreeJS.

### What can the project do right now?
At the moment you can draw cubes, spheres and create lights however I plan to extend the extension over the coming months to allow custom models (.obj) to be used and textures. This is going to take a bit longer as I don't have a huge amount of free time at the moment, so I decided to release it as-is and as the extension isn't minified so you can tweak it until your heart is content or play with the dev branch.

One of the best features right now is the ability to use GameMaker's room editor to setup levels.
